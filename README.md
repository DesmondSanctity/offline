**offline** is a service-worker boilerplate for building progressive web apps.

## Overview 

service workers are basically web workers that intercepts network request made from a client to the network. 
The ability of service workers to intercept network request before they get to the network gives it the super powers
to make web applications work in any network condition even when your network is in lie-fie mode (lie-fie is [Jake Archibald](https://twitter.com/jaffathecake) word for bad networks).

##  Getting started

To get started using offline follow the following procedures:

* Clone this repo to your local machine
* Copy the `sw.js` file which conatains boilerplate code.
* Copy the `index.js` file which contains the code for the service worker registration.
* Edit the either of the two files to match your needs.
* Build and deploy your project.
